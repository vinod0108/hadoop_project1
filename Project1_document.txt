PROJECT - USA Crime Analysis

Project Objectives 

1.Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under each
FBI code
2. Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under FBI
code 32.
3. Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of arrests in theft district wise.
4. Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of arrests done between October
2014 and October 2015.

Solution 

Given data file is loaded is loaded in to hdfs using the put command 

hdfs dfs -put Crimes_-Project1.csv  /crime_data

Mapreduce code is used to accomplish the objectives given 
Maven is used to build jar 
Eclipse IDE is used as Editor
to run the code jar is exported from the eclipse and it executed in the command line by passing  the inoput file path the output path :
            For Example : yarn jar Arrests_dist_Count.jar /crime_csv /outputArrestdis
Output is view in the hdfs shell using the cat command :
            Foe example :   hdfs dfs -cat /outputArrest/part-r-00000
Else from the HDFS web UI
               http://hadoop.com:50070/explorer.html#/output1
